# Defender Mind

Defender Mind is an interactive 3D visualization platform for security incidents with integrated configuration and management capabilities.

Demo available at https://demo.defender.zone

## Overview

This application provides a visually engaging way to display, manage, and respond to security incidents through an interactive neural network visualization. Security incidents are represented as special nodes within a 3D brain-like network, with complete response playbooks that can be displayed when incidents are selected.

## Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to run Defender Mind is using Docker Compose, which handles all dependencies automatically.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine

2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory

3. Build and start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the application in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Stopping the Application

To stop the application:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Brain Network Visualization**: Engaging visualization with responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- **Security Incident Management**: Create, edit, and manage security incident response playbooks
- **Step-by-Step Response Plans**: Each incident includes detailed steps for proper incident response
- **Configurable Incidents**: Add, edit, remove and customize security incidents with a built-in configuration panel
- **Persistent Storage**: All changes are automatically saved to a JSON file in a Docker volume
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find incidents by title or content
- **Visual Customization**: Customize incident node colors and appearance
- **Export/Import**: Share incident configurations between deployments

## Visual Elements

- Animated 3D brain network with glowing nodes and connections
- Interactive security incident nodes with custom colors
- Floating labels that adapt to viewing angle
- Step-by-step incident response playbooks
- Subtle cursor aurora effects for better interactivity
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Configuration Mode

The configuration panel allows you to:

- Add new security incidents
- Edit existing incidents and their response steps
- Customize colors and appearance
- Assign incidents to specific network nodes
- Export and import incident configurations

## Public Display Mode

For public displays or shared environments where you don't want users to modify incidents, use the `DISABLE_CONFIG` environment variable:

1. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and set:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - NODE_ENV=production
     - DISABLE_CONFIG=true
   ```

2. Restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will hide the configuration button entirely, making it impossible for users to modify incident data. The setting is controlled at the server level for improved security.

Alternatively, you can use a URL parameter to temporarily hide the configuration interface:

```
http://localhost:3000/?hideConfig=true
```

## Mobile Improvements

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Touch controls for rotating and zooming the brain network
- Incident node labels are clickable on mobile for easier interaction
- "Reset View" button on mobile to easily return to the default view
- Optimized rendering for better performance on mobile devices

## Persistence

All incident data is saved to a persistent Docker volume. This means your changes will be preserved even if you restart the container.

The default JSON file is stored in both the container at: `/app/data/security-incidents.json`
And in your host machine at: '/var/lib/docker/volumes/defendermind_defender-data/_data/security-incidents.json'

## Manual Data Export/Import

When configuration is enabled, you can manually export and import data through the configuration panel:

1. Click the "‚öôÔ∏è" gear icon button to open the configuration panel
2. Use the "üì§ Export" button to download a JSON file
3. Use the "üì• Import" button to load a JSON file

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Port

To change the default port (3000), modify the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  defender-zone:
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"  # Change 8080 to your desired port
```

### Server-side Configuration

The application uses a simple Express.js server to handle:

- Serving static files
- Saving and loading incident data
- Configuration state management

### Updating Default Incidents

Default incidents are stored in `server.js` and automatically loaded when no JSON file exists. To change the defaults:

1. Edit the `defaultIncidents` array in `server.js`
2. Rebuild the container: `docker-compose up -d --build`

## Rebuilding the Application

If you make changes to the source code and need to rebuild:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Technical Components

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js for brain network visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for saving configuration
- **Containerization**: Docker for easy deployment
- **Storage**: Local JSON file for persistent data

## Performance Considerations

- The application uses hardware acceleration for 3D rendering
- Mobile devices have optimized settings with fewer particles and effects
- Responsive design adapts visualization complexity based on device capabilities

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and optimized for:
- Chrome (latest versions)
- Firefox (latest versions)
- Edge (latest versions)
- Safari (latest versions)

## OS Compatibility

Testing has primarily been performed on:
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

While the application should work on other operating systems, some bugs may surface on untested platforms.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check that Docker is running
- Ensure port 3000 is not already in use
- View logs with `docker-compose logs`
- Verify the correct environment variables are set in docker-compose.yml
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try clearing browser cache and refreshing
- For mobile issues, ensure your device supports WebGL

### Common Issues

1. **Black screen or no visualization**: Your browser may not support WebGL or have it disabled
2. **Configuration button not responding**: Check if configuration is disabled in environment variables
3. **Changes not saving**: Verify Docker volume permissions
4. **Slow performance**: Reduce browser window size or try a device with better graphics capabilities
